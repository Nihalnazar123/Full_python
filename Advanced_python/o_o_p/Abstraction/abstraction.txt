Abstraction
-----------
 Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user.
 This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming. That enables the user to implement even more complex
 logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden background/back-end complexity.


 An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that
 must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract
 methods is called an abstract class. An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an
 implementation. While we are designing large functional units we use an abstract class. When we want to provide a
 common interface for different implementations of a component, we use an abstract class.
