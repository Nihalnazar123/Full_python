Encapsulation
--------------
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping
data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly
and can prevent the accidental modification of data.To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed
by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.
(Encapsulation in Python describes the concept of bundling data and methods within a single unit.)
So, for example, when you create a class, it means you are implementing encapsulation.
A class is an example of encapsulation as it binds all the data members (instance variables) and methods into a single unit.
